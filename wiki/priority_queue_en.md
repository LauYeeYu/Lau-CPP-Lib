# lau::PriorityQueue

Switch to Other Languages: [繁體中文（香港）](priority_queue_zh.md)

Included in header `lau/priority_queue.h`.

```c++
namespace lau {
template<class T,
         class Compare = std::less<T>,
         class Allocator = std::allocator<T>>
class PriorityQueue;
} // namespace lau
```

`lau::PriorityQueue` is a queue that makes sure the element with priority will
be popped later than with less priority.  Therefore, the top element is the
one with the least priority, and it will be popped first.

A customized compare function can be supplied to compare the elements.  Note
that the `Compare` must have overloaded the `operator()` with two parameters.

This priority queue uses leftist tree as the data structure.  For more
information about the data structure, please go to the
[detail of data structure](#DataStructure).

Please note that because most operation in this class depends on recursive
functions, enough memory space must be reserved for stack to avoid stack
overflow.

## Overview

namespace lau {
template<class T,
         class Compare = std::less<T>,
         class Allocator = std::allocator<T>>
class PriorityQueue {

## Template
- `T`: the type of element
- `Compare`: the type of compare function (`std::less<T>` is default)
  - need to satisfy the C++ comparing class requirements (see
    [C++ named requirements: Compare](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare))
    - `bool Compare(const T& lhs, const T& rhs)` must be available.
    - If `Compare(a, b) = false` and `Compare(a, b) = false`, or
      `Compare(a, b) = true` and `Compare(a, b) = true`, `a` must be the
      same as `b`. (Uniqueness)
- `Allocator`: the type of allocator
  - need to satisfy the C++ allocator requirements (see
    [C++ named requirements: Allocator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Allocator))
  - `std::allocator` is default.

## Details
### <span id="DataStructure">Data Structure</span>
This priority queue uses leftist tree as data structure.  As opposed to a
binary heap, a leftist tree attempts to be very unbalanced.  In addition to
the heap property, leftist trees are maintained so the right descendant of
each node has the lower s-value.

Every modification depends on merging.  Pushing a new element is merging a
single node binary heap into the main tree.  Popping from the queue is merging
the left descendant with the right one.  Merging two queue is to merge the two
trees together.

Complexity:
- Push: $O(\log n)$
- Pop: $O(\log n)$
- Merge: $O(\log n)$
